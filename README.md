# Fake-News-Detection-LSTM-Classification

## Overview
The **Fake-News-Detection-LSTM** project aims to build a robust machine learning model to detect fake news articles using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and word embedding using Word2Vec or GloVe.
- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes an LSTM network to capture long-term dependencies in the text data.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains the LSTM model on a labeled dataset and evaluates its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization of model performance metrics and loss curves.
